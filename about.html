                                 Out of a soft white cloud on a sweet summer day I was born, a bit of soft material of feathers had within by the most smooth, most comfortable silk, the same material that makes up servant of the father of all's wings . Mother Sky gave me the name wind for the kind, quiet, not rough wind that blew a smile on my face the day I was born. She made me until I was able to take care of myself, and then I left my surprising Sky starting place to offer love and comfort to a very young person of the Earth while she slept.

                                 I was welcomed with a smile. My new family admired my beautiful blue cover. I was taken to a room and placed on the bed. The bed was beautifully made. The study table, the dolls, the toys showed that the room belonged to a kid. I waited patiently to see who would be my new friend.A young girl entered the room. She was very happy to see me. She held me in her arms and shouted, "soft! soft! I love it" and laughed. That was the start of a beautiful friendship.Every night her mother would give her a good night kiss and leave. I would then caress her till my little angel wandered into the beautiful world of dreams.With me she has won many a cushion fights that she had with her brother.

                              <p>As my little angel is growing I can see that things are no longer the same. Today she doesn't fall asleep with her Mum's goodnight kiss. Instead she reads herself to sleep. Many a days I have also caught her talking over the phone till late in the night and a good night kiss from the people who she likes most which makes her finally fall asleep. Hmmmmmm my angel is growing up!

                                 When she was a kid she would take my help to hide her comics and chocolates. But today she uses me to hide her tears from the world. Sometimes she cries all night and falls asleep with tears in her eyes. I feel so helpless. I am the only witness of the pain and tears of my little angel. She holds me and cries and even shares her pain with me. I cry with her. I cry seeing the pain of my angel….I cry because I cannot do anything to stop her tears…I cry seeing the 'strong and independent girl' which she is for the world, break down this way. I will also glad to accept that i am one of the important persons with whome she shares all of her happiness and love!

                                 I am growing old now. My blue cover is no longer the same. Do not know how long I'll be able to keep her company. The other day ,I heard her Mum complain that she needs a good head rester for better sleep. She thinks I need a rest. I do not mind being tired of caring her. But I just don’t want to leave my angel. I just want to be with her and share her feelings. I just want to be with her when she has tears in her eyes and no one to wipe them. I just want to be with my angel and caress her while she drowned at beautiful dreams for herself. I just want to be there with her when she hangs up the phone at night and tries to hide her smile and her emotion. I just want to be with her……..till she finds a shoulder to rest on…..till she finds the hand to wipe her tears…till she finds the person from whom she doesn’t have to hide her tears.
